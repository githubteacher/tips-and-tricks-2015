**Description:**

Do you have questions about git and GitHub?

Are you new to git or GitHub, but want to learn what all the "social coding" fuss is about? Want to "level up" your contributions to open source? Curious to learn how GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub?

Bring your questions to this Q&A about Git and GitHub. I'm Joshua Wehner ([@jaw6 on GitHub!](//github.com/jaw6), a developer and trainer at GitHub, I'll do my best to answer all your questions, tell stories, do a few demos, and I'll bring plenty of octocat stickers for everyone.
